# Audio transcript preview tool

## How to start

Run `miniweb.exe` in this directory to start a web server

Open Chrome and navigate to:

[http://10.228.155.49:8000/](http://10.228.155.49:8000/)

You should now see the preview tool.

## Adding audio files

Add MP3 and matching VTT files to the "AUDIO_FILES" directory.

Each file and its matching mp3 should have exactly the same
 filename (only the ".mp3" or ".vtt" file extension should
  distinguish the files.)

## Running a preview

In Chrome click "Choose Files" then navigate to the 
 "AUDIO_FILES" folder and open all the files. The preview should begin.
