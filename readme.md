# Audio transcript preview tool

## How to start

Run `start.bat` in this directory to start a web server

Open Chrome and navigate to:

[http://localhost:8082/](http://localhost:8082/)

You should now see the preview tool.

## Adding audio files

Add MP3 and matching VTT files to the `AUDIO_AND_VIDEO_FILES` directory.

Each file and its matching mp3 should have exactly the same
 filename (only the ".mp3" or ".vtt" file extension should
  distinguish the files.)

## Running a preview

In Chrome click "Choose Files" then navigate to the 
 `AUDIO_AND_VIDEO_FILES` folder and open all the files. The preview should begin.
